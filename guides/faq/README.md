# Frequently Asked Questions

## How much does WebPG Cost

WebPG costs you _nothing_!

## Who developed these products

The WebPG project was originally developed by [Kyle L. Huff](http://curetheitch.com/ "curetheitch.com")

Since the initial development cycle, various developers and contributors have provided support, patches, translations, testing and technical expertise.

## Why should I donate to WebPG

WebPG is an open source project; this means that all of the work that goes into development, testing, maintenance and distribution is entirely on a volunteer basis.  The WebPG project does not charge for it's services or products, but that does not mean there is no cost associated with the project activities.

Donations to the WebPG project can come in many forms - monetary, patches, bug/issue reports, user support and testing of new versions.

Some of those items simply cannot be done solely by the project maintainers, and those contributions are a _huge_ help at keeping the project on it's wheels.

As an example, most of the translations in WebPG are provided by the users (as a donation by way of services); without that contribution WebPG would only be available in English.

Aside from non-monetary contributions, there are real world costs ($$) associated with the project, below is list of some of those items and their yearly cost

Item | Cost per year
:--- | ---:
Web hosting | $180
Digital Certificates | $100
Donations to other frameworks | $300
Software licensing | $600
**TOTAL** | ~$1180
